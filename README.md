OTTrees
This application was made using the city of Ottawa's open data tree inventory to show unique information about the trees owned and cared for by the city. By showing the trees in this light, we hope to give the residents of Ottawa a different perspective by unveiling a bird’s eye view of the city; the trees displayed show foliage based on the season, the location, and the estimated span of branches over the houses and buildings of the city.
